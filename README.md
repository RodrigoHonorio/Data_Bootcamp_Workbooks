## 🖼️ Have a Gander at Some Visuals

### 📘 Week 1 – Excel Essentials: Looking Things Up, Summing Up, and Breaking Things Down

#### 🔍 The Magic of VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP in Action

![VLOOKUP Formula Example](Assets/week1_lookup_formula_example.png)  
*Using VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP to dynamically find info between tables, like employee details.*

---

#### 📊 The Power of Pivot Tables: Bike Sales Breakdown

![Bike Sales Pivot Table](Assets/week1_bike_sales_pivot_table.png)  
*Summing up how sales are doing by region and product, using the handy Pivot Tables in Excel.*

---

#### 🔄 Clever Stuff with the SWITCH Function: Sorting Sales Performance

![SWITCH Function Example](Assets/week1_switch_function_example.png)  
*Customising how sales performance is categorised (High, Medium, Low) using the SWITCH function, all linked up to the summary.*

This week really got me sorted with the basics of Excel, showing how structured functions and summing-up tools like pivot tables can quickly show you what's what.

---

### 📘 Week 2 – Making Data Look Good with Tableau

#### 🎵 Unpacking Music Trends with the Spotify Dashboard

![Spotify Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_spotify_dashboard.png)  
*Having a look at listening habits across different music types in Tableau, focusing on energy, danceability, and popularity to see what gets people going.*

---

#### 📈 Looking at Job Changes in the UK (EMSI Dataset)

![EMSI Job Change Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_jobchange_dashboard.png)  
*Showing how employment's changed using bar charts and a map of the UK, highlighting which sectors are doing what in the big cities.*

---

#### 🏥 Health Insights from the NHS in a Handy Dashboard

![NHS Health Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_nhs_dashboard.png)  
*Analysing life expectancy, obesity levels, and cancer rates by region to help with health service planning and spotting trends.*

This week really boosted my practical skills with both Tableau and Power BI. I used Tableau to knock up interactive dashboards that showed real-world insights from music and health data, while the Power BI labs helped me get my head around loading data, changing it about, and designing reports.

### 📘 Week 3 – SQL and How Relational Databases Hang Together

#### 🔄 Making Sense of Data with SQL JOIN Queries

![SQL Join Query](Assets/week3_sql_joins.png)  
*Using JOIN operations to bring together related tables and get the info I needed.*

---

#### 🏗️ How Databases are Put Together and Table Structures

![Database Design](Assets/week3_database_design.png)  
*Outlining the structure of a database for a shop using SQL table definitions and explaining how these linked-up models help with bigger analyses.*

---

#### 📊 What SQL Queries Actually Show

![SQL Query Outputs](Assets/week3_sql_practical_outputs.png)  
*Running queries to filter and group data using real-world datasets to count things, set conditions, and see how different bits of data relate to each other.*

In Week 3, I was all about how relational databases are designed and how to query them with SQL. I practised using JOIN operations, filtering queries, and setting up table structures for a pretend shop. This made me much more confident in reading and writing SQL to get at structured data.

### 📘 Week 5 – Cloud Platforms, Azure Labs, and Thinking About What Could Happen

#### ☁️ A Look at the Azure Labs

![Azure Labs Combined](Assets/week5_azure_labs_combined.png)  
*Working through guided labs on relational data, non-relational data, and how Azure does analytics. This included having a go with data lake storage, SQL databases, and using Azure Synapse for queries.*

---

#### 🐾 Azure Ideas – The Paws & Whiskers Case Study

![Azure Recommendations](Assets/week5_azure_recommendations.png)  
*Putting forward a cloud setup using Azure Data Factory, Power BI, and Blob Storage to bring a pet supply company's data handling into the modern age.*

This week really deepened my understanding of cloud platforms and how data systems are put together. I looked at how Azure deals with different types of data and used that knowledge to come up with a real-world solution for a made-up business. I got a clearer picture of how data moves through cloud systems and where analysts and data engineers fit into all that.

#### 🌍 Analysing GDP per Person

![GDP Analysis](Assets/week6_gdp_analysis.png)  
*Looking at GDP per capita across different countries and UN regions, filtering and slicing the data using code.*

In Week 6, I used Python and the Pandas library to explore, clean up, change about, and analyse datasets using Jupyter Notebook. I worked with structured data (student.csv) and real-world data (GDP per capita), doing grouping, summing up, and pivoting. I also had a go at making data look good with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, which has really helped me show trends and patterns clearly and interactively.

## ✅ Skills I've Picked Up

- Getting the hang of Excel lookups, pivot tables, and making things automatic
- Understanding how RDBMS works and writing SQL queries that do the job
- Putting together dashboards and understanding the basics of DAX in Power BI
- Using Python to wrangle data and make it visual
- Knowing about GDPR, data ethics, and cloud services (Azure)
- Creating interactive dashboards in Tableau Public to see location-based stuff and trends, using real-world datasets like EMSI (UK Job Changes) and Spotify listening habits.
- Getting familiar with **cloud computing concepts** and tools, including Azure data services

## 🎯 My Thoughts on How It's Going

These workbooks show how I'm coming along as someone learning to be a data analyst — balancing the technical bits, writing up my analysis, and thinking critically. Each week threw up new challenges and chances to get more confident with the whole data process.
